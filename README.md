## About the Project

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening, especially if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Chest X-ray images are commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but interpretation can be challenging. This project aims to provide a tool for automated pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images using deep learning.
